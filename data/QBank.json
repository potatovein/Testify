However, some adults may experience asthma that is not due to allergy, this is non-allergic asthma (1). Late-onset asthma (1) occurs in some adults, where asthma presents for the first time in adult time (1). This is typically non-allergic. Asthma with fixed airflow limitation (1) can form in patients with long-term asthma that develop airflow limitation (1) due to airway wall remodelling (1). Asthma can occur in obese patients, where there is little airway inflammation but prominent respiratory symptoms (1), this is termed asthma with obesity (1).",

                    "Answer": "Muscarinic receptors cause relaxation of muscle cells (1) \u2013 lowering blood pressure. However, atropine blocks these receptors, preventing acetylcholine from binding (1). Acetylcholine can still bind to nicotinic receptors (1), found at preganglionic synapses of the sympathetic nervous system (1). This causes activation of the sympathetic nervous system (1) and therefore contraction of cardiac and vascular smooth muscle (1), increasing heart rate and blood pressure. Muscarine cannot bind to nicotinic receptors, so increasing the dose has no effect (1).",

                    "Answer": "Haemostatic dressings are designed to stop bleeding quickly (1), intended for use in trauma or emergency settings such as military operations / control life-threatening haemorrhage (1). They activate clotting factors (1) promoting rapid haemostasis (1). Examples include QuikClot / HemCon (1). Occlusive dressings consist of an impermeable film (1) covering the wound. This prevents microbial entry (1) and traps moisture at the wound site (1). This is shown to enhance wound healing (1) and reduce risk of infection (1). Rapid re-epithelialisation occurs in acute wounds (1) and granulation tissue formation is enhanced in chronic wounds (1). Wound healing is faster in wet environments (1). Hydrogel dressings are gels consisting of 90% water (1). They are primarily used to rehydrate dry necrotic tissue (1) and autolytic debridement / loosen slough (1). These maintain an optimum environment for re-epithelialisation (1), reducing scarring (1). Antimicrobial dressings are impregnated with antimicrobial agents (1), such as silver / iodine / polyhexamethylene biguanide / chlorhexidine / honey (1). These help to manage colonised / infected wounds (1) and prevent biofilm formation (1). Acetic acid (1) used for colonised burns (1). Each type used to support healing differently, where haemostatic dressings prevent excess blood loss (1), antimicrobial dressings control infection (1), hydrogel dressings assist in debridement (1), occlusive dressings optimise moisture content for wound healing (1).",

In the mesocortical pathway (1), this can lead to worsening negative symptoms (1). In the mesolimbic pathway (1), this improves positive symptoms (1) as they are due to overactivity (1) of this pathway. D2 blockade in nigrostriatal pathway can cause extrapyramidal side effects (1). Atypical antipsychotics have a lower affinity for D2 receptors (1), therefore they have less of a D2 blockade effect (1), resulting in less exacerbation of negative symptoms (1) and lower risk of EPS (1). Negative symptoms are improved slightly (1) due to antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors (1), promoting dopamine release in the mesocortical pathway (1). D2 blockade still occurs in mesocortical pathway (1), improving positive symptoms (1).",

The kappa receptor is considered the safest to target (1), however activation can cause sedation (1) and psychological side effects / anxiety / depression / psychosis (1).

This is because morphine is a polar molecule (1) due to the ionised amine group and phenol (1). The blood brain barrier prevents ionized / polar drugs from crossing into the CNS (1). Morphine can cross as the amine is a weak base (1) \u2013 not fully ionised (1). Ability to cross BBB increased by decreasing polarity (1), addition of acetyl group at hydroxyl groups (1) increases potency. Addition of acetyl at carbon 6 increases potency 4x (1), whereas addition at carbon 3 and 6 increases potency 2x (1), as 3-acetyl group must be hydrolysed before active (1).",

This is beneficial for storage in cells (1), as it prevents degradation (1). The hexamer form is also more compact (1). The dimer form is partially active and can diffuse better than hexamers, however less so than the monomer (1). They are more stable than monomers (1). They form an intermediate step, which can be used in formulations for a delayed onset of action (1). Long-acting insulins will use modified structures to control the stability of this dimer, delaying monomer formation (1). Insulin monomers are fully active and diffuse across capillaries rapidly but are not stable (1). Monomers formulations can be used to provide immediate onset of action (1).",

However, insulin aggregation can cause inconsistent delivery (1), which could lead to ketoacidosis as insufficient insulin is administered (1). Automated insulin delivery systems (artificial pancreas) are useful as they can automatically monitor blood glucose levels (1) and adjust the insulin dose for appropriate control (1). This comes with a reduced risk of hypoglycaemia (1) and reduces the need for patient interaction, improving quality of life (1). However, these machines can be high in cost (1), and can malfunction, leading to incorrect or lack of dosing (1). Formulations that do not require insulin have been developed; this is useful for patients who have needlephobia (1) or simply don\u2019t want to inject throughout the day (1). However, these were typically removed from the market due to a high cost and lack of widespread adoption (1)",
